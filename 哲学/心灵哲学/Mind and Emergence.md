> 1. Ontological physicalism: All that exists in the space-time world are the basic particles recognized by physics and their aggregates.
>
> 2. Property emergence: When aggregates of material particles attain an appropriate level of organizational complexity, genuinely novel properties emerge in these complex systems.
>
